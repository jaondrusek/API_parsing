Through these prosthetics, the weak are made strong, and the dying are given new life. Public Security Section 9 of Niihama City (a fictional setting inspired by Hong Kong), a diverse team of AI, cyborgs and unmodified humans, must investigate cases of corruption and terrorism. Major Motoko Kusanagi has full-body prosthetics, owing to a childhood accident. She, her second in command Batou and information specialist Ishikawa have been assigned an important task: to investigate a hacker known only as &quot;The Puppetmaster.&quot; But as Motoko and her team discover, things are never so simple. Ghost in the Shell is a futuristic thriller with intense action scenes mixed with slower artistic sequences and many philosophical questions about one's soul, gender and human identity in such an advanced age of technology.", "score": [8.34, 162807], "year": "Nov 18, 1995", "genre": [["1/Action", "Action"], ["24/Sci-Fi", "Sci-Fi"], ["39/Police", "Police"], ["40/Psychological", "Psychological"], ["18/Mecha", "Mecha"], ["42/Seinen", "Seinen"]], "media_type": "Movie", "id": "43"}
