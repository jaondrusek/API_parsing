Two years ago, he mysteriously lost his memory and developed an alternate personality. His mother constantly berates (and occasionally beats) him, asking what happened to the &quot;real&quot; Ritsuka, and his only defender and friend, his older brother Seimei, was recently killed. Suddenly, Seimei&#039;s apparent &quot;friend,&quot; Soubi, appears. Soubi tells him that Ritsuka&#039;s true name is &quot;Loveless,&quot; and that Soubi was assigned by Seimei to take care of Ritsuka and protect him. Ritsuka soon gets sucked into a bizzare underground society where teams of people, a &quot;Fighter Unit,&quot; and a &quot;Sacrifice,&quot; battle using elaborate and beautifully-phrased spells. He seeks both acceptance of himself, and the answer to the mystery of who killed his brother and why.
