Of course, then he just happens to find out the school he choose is under frequent attack by strange creatures called &#039;&#039;Orphans&#039;&#039;, and the school set up a special task force of female members called &#039;&#039;HiME&#039;&#039;s, using various elements as their powers, to battle these invaders. That&#039;s not all, though. Each member of the HiME task force has their own, unique &#039;&#039;Key&#039;&#039;, another person whom, upon being discovered, can team up with the HiME to create a &#039;&#039;Child&#039;&#039;, a combative unit specifically needed to effectively battle these Orphans. And with Yuuichi&#039;s luck, he just happens to find out he&#039;s not just the &#039;&#039;Key&#039;&#039; for one of the HiMEs, but for two... Two highly competitive, rival schoolgirls. And that&#039;s only the start of the trouble. (Source: Tokyopop)", "volumes": 5, "published": "Nov  11, 2004 to Jul  7, 2005", "title-english": "My-HiME"}
