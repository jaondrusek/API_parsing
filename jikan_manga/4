Fuji has erupted within living memory. The population has been considerably reduced and political and technological institutions have broken-down. Local communities have become nations and telephone and television no longer exist (although coffee vending machines and streetlights stubbornly continue to work). There are strange new animals and plants (like flying fish and glowing streetlight trees). The remaining people have adopted a slower-paced, simpler way of life and rely more on each other. Along with the human population are some intelligent, humanoid robots. One of the robots, a female named Alpha, runs a caf\u00e9 by the same name in the country outside of what remains of Yokohama. With her trusty motor scooter and her camera she travels around the area making friends with the humans and robots, having new experiences and observing the passage of time.", "synonyms": "Yokohama Shopping Log, Yokohama Shopping Trip, Touge", "related": {"Adaptation:": [{"url": "/anime/975/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kikou", "name": "Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou"}, {"url": "/anime/976/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kikou__Quiet_Country_Cafe", "name": "Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou: Quiet Country Cafe</a>"}]}, "volumes": 14, "published": "Apr  25, 1994 to Feb  25, 2006", "genre": [["8/Drama", "Drama"], ["24/Sci-Fi", "Sci-Fi"], ["36/Slice_of_Life", "Slice of Life"], ["41/Seinen", "Seinen"]], "serialization": ["Afternoon", "/manga/magazine/4/Afternoon"], "type": "Manga"}
