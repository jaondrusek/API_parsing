It tells the story of a peaceful wanderer named Himura Kenshin, formerly known as the assassin Hitokiri Battousai. After participating during the Bakumatsu war, Kenshin wanders the countryside of Japan offering protection and aid to those in need as atonement for the murders he once committed as an assassin. When arriving in Tokyo, he meets a young woman named Kamiya Kaoru, who was in the middle of a fight with a murderer who claims to be the Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai from her swordmanship school. Kenshin decides to help her and defeats the fake Battousai. After discovering that Kenshin is the real Batt\u014dsai, she offers him a place stay at her dojo as she notes Kenshin is a gentle person instead. Kenshin accepts and begins to establish lifelong relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, while dealing with his fair share of enemies, new and old.
