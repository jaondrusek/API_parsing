With Festum on the warpath, it&#039;s up to the island&#039;s dedicated inhabitants to pilot powerful Fafners and fight back! Before the gun smoke clears, illusions will be shattered and lifelong friendships will be stretched to their limits. Will this peaceful island survive the chaos of all-out war? Fafner- Dead Aggressor is a full-throttle fight in the name of defending peace and defeating evil! When a group of friends gears up to take on vicious Festum attackers, there&#039;s no telling who will become a hero...and who will be sacrificed to the ravages of battle. Life as they know it is on the line, and these brand-new soldiers learn to trust their instincts (and one another) in order to man their Fafners with fearless skill. Man and machine unite to take down all invaders...and save the homeland!
