Nana Osaki, on the other hand, is cool, confident and focused. She swaggers into town and proceeds to kick down the doors to Tokyo&#039;s underground punk scene. She&#039;s got a dream and won&#039;t give up until she becomes Japan&#039;s No. 1 rock&#039;n&#039;roll superstar. This is the story of two 20-year-old women who share the same name. Even though they come from completely different backgrounds, they somehow meet and become best friends. The world of Nana is a world exploding with sex, music, fashion, gossip and all-night parties.
