They often played together. But Hotaru is a very special child, and she agrees to go to a school in Tokyo which the government reserved only for geniuses. This left a very lonely Mikan at home. When Hotaru fails to keep her promise and come home for holidays, her young friend is very disappointed and rather angry. But upon overhearing a conversation between Hotaru&#039;s mother and a teacher, Mikan realizes that her friend&#039;s reasons for leaving might not have been what they seemed. So Mikan takes it upon herself to run away and go to Hotaru&#039;s school. There she discovers the so-called &quot;genius academy&quot; is actually a school for people gifted with special powers called &quot;alices.&quot; Her friend Hotaru is one of these, and after a chance encounter with a teacher, Mikan suddenly finds herself enrolled. Finally, the two friends are reunited, but is Mikan actually one of those so-called Alices?
