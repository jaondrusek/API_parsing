{"about": "The eldest daughter of Pantasia. Yukino can be quite cruel, such as by placing Tsukino's mother's remains under a withered tree instead of her proper grave. She had intended to buy up her grandfather's stock but ended up being the president of St. Pierre in a twist. She has a grudge against Pantasia and ended up trying to exhaust Pantasia's 12 billion yen won by Kanmuri when he bet on Team Japan during the Monaco Cup. She seems to have a sexual relationship with Y\u016buchi Kirisaki. This character is another one of Azuma's antagonists and possesses the opposite of Solar hands: Snow Storm Hands. She also dislikes Tsukino heavily, even to the point of insulting her, which anger Azuma thoroughly.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Yukino Azusagawa", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/110969.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/28467.jpg?s=aadb146f9087d5ff202de2fb44d644a7", "link": "/manga/653/Yakitate_Japan", "name": "Yakitate!!
