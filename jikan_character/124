{"about": "Age:15\n Birthday: March 15, Cosmic Era 56\n Blood Type: A\n Genetic Type: Natural\n Height:162cm\n Weight: 53kg\n \n She is the somewhat-spoiled daughter of the Vice Foreign Affairs Minister, George Allster to the Atlantic Federation. (North, South America and the UK) She likes to pamper herself with expensive beauty cleansers. Her faults are she is easily angered and has a bad habit of saying what&#039;s on her mind without thinking things through. Being from the Atlantic Federation, she loathes Coordinators because they aren&#039;t what nature intended them to be.\n \n After seeing her father&#039;s ship blown up in front of her eyes, she becomes mentally unstable and uses Kira through sexual manipulation to avenge her fathers death. Though she is engaged to Sai, (their parents arranged the engagement) she breaks off the relationship to be with Kira,whom she takes advantage of his mental state and his feelings for her.\n \n Later, her hatred towards Coordinators disappears and no longer has a need for vengeance when she experienced being with them at a Zaft ship.\n \n \n In Kira&#039;s absence, she realized that she had loved him. She became guilty of her actions and strongly wanted to talk with everyone, especially with Kira and apologize to him, but she failed when her shuttle was shot by the Providence.\n As Kira cries in agony when he witnesses her death, though he can&#039;t see nor hear her, her spirit hovered beside him and comforted him. She apologizes to him and tells him that because of suffering, she has been blinded from reality, but now she&#039;s free. Her last words are \"My true feelings will protect you.\"\n\n", "name": "Flay Allster", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/298709.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/126203.jpg?s=a624d647d267db41fbf3d13a2d06e348", "link": "/manga/593/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_SEED__Astray", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam SEED: Astray"}], "member-favorites": 75, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/16838.jpg?s=8463925114fc46289e748705b8d0c1c0", "link": "/anime/93/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/2503.jpg?s=90fd81363744ea56363148ec5b37c1db", "link": "/anime/2269/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Special_Edition", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Special Edition"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30d5\u30ec\u30a4\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/32905v.jpg", "link": "/people/57/Houko_Kuwashima", "name": "Kuwashima, Houko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/41827v.jpg", "link": "/people/545/Tabitha_St_Germain", "name": "St. Germain, Tabitha", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15815v.jpg", "link": "/people/14983/Ui_Jin_Chae", "name": "Chae, Ui Jin", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/35731v.jpg", "link": "/people/25805/Erica_Mendez", "name": "Mendez, Erica", "language": "English"}]}
