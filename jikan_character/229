{"about": "Minoru is a wealthy twelve year old who specializes in Persocoms, and has built his own custom Persocom named Yuzuki, who is meant to be almost exactly like his late sister. He becomes one of Hideki's closest friends when he becomes interested in Chii's origins, and assists him whenever there's a problem. He is calm and collective most of the time, buthis attitude tends to change whenever Yuzuki is around, and is prone to outbursts whenever she is in trouble, much like Hideki when Chii is in trouble. He is also a very forgiving character, always telling Yuzuki that it is not her fault whenever something goes wrong.\n\n", "name": "Minoru Kokubunji", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/139267.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/164969.jpg?s=b39419fa5fc6444e3558dc8309fc32ec", "link": "/manga/107/Chobits", "name": "Chobits"}], "member-favorites": 26, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/24648.jpg?s=5b6343af2882765f8ae9d92247c619af", "link": "/anime/59/Chobits", "name": "Chobits"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/22857.jpg?s=26d23d100fdcc0e8c94f536835c614e4", "link": "/anime/1311/Chobits_Recap", "name": "Chobits Recap"}], "name-japanese": "(\u56fd\u5206\u5bfa \u7a14)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/32905v.jpg", "link": "/people/57/Houko_Kuwashima", "name": "Kuwashima, Houko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/39414v.jpg", "link": "/people/319/Mona_Marshall", "name": "Marshall, Mona", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/28019v.jpg", "link": "/people/9747/Susan_Sindberg", "name": "Sindberg, Susan", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15625v.jpg", "link": "/people/14925/Won_Il_Son", "name": "Son, Won Il", "language": "Korean"}]}
