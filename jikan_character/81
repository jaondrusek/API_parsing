{"about": "A world class clown working as a bread judge, aged 22. He can speak 135 languages, divide into over a hundred copies of himself, and do all sorts of amazing things due to being 'world-class' clown. \n \n Heir to the throne of Monaco, though he doesn't know it at first until the second Monaco Cup competition final. Pierrot learns that he is heir to Monaco only through blood loss; he has an ultra-rare blood type called Bombay blood, which the king of Monaco also has. \n He became a world class clown so that his parents might find him, who he believed had abandoned him at the circus as an infant. \n \n In fact, he was given up to be brought up by ordinary foster parents away from the Royal palace, according to Monaco tradition. But these parents ran away with the money paid to them, leaving Pierrot behind. When they committed suicide, he was pronounced dead, but actually ended up in the Quedam circus. \n\n", "name": "Pierrot Bolneze", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/33049.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/4/28467.jpg?s=aadb146f9087d5ff202de2fb44d644a7", "link": "/manga/653/Yakitate_Japan", "name": "Yakitate!!
