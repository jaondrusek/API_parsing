{"about": "Hikaru's \"big brother\" insei. Like Kaga, he has a dislike for Akira Toya because he can never defeat him and because of Akira's detached attitude towards the game. He has once faced Sai in Internet Go as Zelda for his nickname. He becomes a pro (at age 15) in the same year as Hikaru. He is also known to be very reckless and short-tempered, even punching former insei Mashiba in the face because the latter rattled Isumi. Waya's birthday is August 12th.\n\n", "name": "Yoshitaka Waya", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/75068.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/170574.jpg?s=9219e2b389c68380032347d44c6cec1d", "link": "/manga/20/Hikaru_no_Go", "name": "Hikaru no Go"}], "member-favorites": 34, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/78317.jpg?s=1535e87674c529f600323303ed4a1f0e", "link": "/anime/135/Hikaru_no_Go", "name": "Hikaru no Go"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/78453.jpg?s=33d44f64524c0c8a784079b91c20eb28", "link": "/anime/645/Hikaru_no_Go__Journey_to_the_North_Star_Cup", "name": "Hikaru no Go: Journey to the North Star Cup"}], "name-japanese": "(\u548c\u8c37 \u7fa9\u9ad8)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/12236v.jpg", "link": "/people/429/Reiko_Takagi", "name": "Takagi, Reiko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/41706v.jpg", "link": "/people/813/Matthew_Erickson", "name": "Erickson, Matthew", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/33923v.jpg", "link": "/people/7303/Adrien_Solis", "name": "Solis, Adrien", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/15317v.jpg", "link": "/people/14769/Min_Jeong_Yeo", "name": "Yeo, Min Jeong", "language": "Korean"}]}
