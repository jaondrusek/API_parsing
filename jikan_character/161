{"about": "Age: around 25 (Mid 20&#039;s)\n Height: 5&#039; 8&#039;&#039;\n Weight: 140 lbs.\n Eyes: Violet-blue\n Hair: Purplish-black\n Affiliation: Shinsengumi\n Status: 1st Unit captain\n \n This is the sweet, kind, caring and somewhat feminine legendary swordsman. He likes to irritate Hijikata and the rest of the Shinsengumi by acting like a girl. He loves children and has a sweet tooth, and he adores Kyoto candies. One of the youngest members of the Shinsengumi, he mastered all the sword techniques of the Tennen-rishin-ryuu (the style of kenjutsu used by the Shinsengumi) in his teens and went on to become a teacher in his twenties. He is considered to be one of the best swordsmen of pre-Meiji Japan.\n \n Okita&#039;s childhood name is Soujirou, and you&#039;ll often hear children in the series calling him by that name. The reason he gives for allowing them to call him by such a nostalgic name is that if he uses the name &#039;Okita Souji,&#039; no one will play with him...Yes, he is in his early twenties, but he still plays with children all the same. He is short for a guy and seems to like walking along with his hair flowing freely behind him when he is off-duty.\n \n Hijikata, Okita&#039;s mentor, made Okita choose whether or not he would take up the katana at the age of nine. In episode 7, Okita accuses Hijikata of having made a mistake with him, by allowing him to hold a katana at an age where he was not yet ready to choose.\n \n Although he is an excellent swordsman, he has two weak points. He can&#039;t adjust his strength to accommodate the people around him, and as a result, no one wants to practice with him (since they always end up with injuries). Even with an armour and shinai (bamboo sword), Okita can cause serious injuries. He also has a disease called Tuberculosis which surfaces from time to time.\n\n", "name": "Souji Okita", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/72567.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/183478.jpg?s=3dc137e91dcddf3a03316b44e794c9cf", "link": "/manga/473/Peace_Maker_Kurogane", "name": "Peace Maker Kurogane"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/120697.jpg?s=dc5e4db8668eb37caa978781e01b60ca", "link": "/manga/474/Shinsengumi_Imon_Peace_Maker", "name": "Shinsengumi Imon Peace Maker"}], "member-favorites": 249, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/77408.jpg?s=64796ce31235ea05bfa641b91f0463cc", "link": "/anime/161/Peace_Maker_Kurogane", "name": "Peace Maker Kurogane"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/7/26485.jpg?s=a0871287453b523fbd66a049e507fef7", "link": "/anime/9568/Peace_Maker_Kurogane_Special", "name": "Peace Maker Kurogane Special"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/88374.jpg?s=d65bb96ccb63431731283d236cba548d", "link": "/anime/33185/Peace_Maker_Kurogane_Movie_1__Omou_Michi", "name": "Peace Maker Kurogane Movie 1: Omou Michi"}], "name-japanese": "(\u6c96\u7530 \u7dcf\u53f8)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/9931v.jpg", "link": "/people/197/Mitsuki_Saiga", "name": "Saiga, Mitsuki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/1467v.jpg", "link": "/people/1028/Braden_Hunt", "name": "Hunt, Braden", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/5817v.jpg", "link": "/people/6105/David_Turba", "name": "Turba, David", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/28767v.jpg", "link": "/people/26575/R\u00e9mi_Caillebot", "name": "Caillebot, R\u00e9mi", "language": "French"}]}
