Like his teammate Yzak Joule, Dearka is the son of a PLANT Supreme Council member, and they share the same arrogant attitude. However, unlike his hot-headed comrade, Dearka usually expresses his scorn for Naturals and weaklings in the form of detached sarcasm.\n \n Gundam SEED Destiny\n After defecting to the Archangel during the previous war, Dearka has now been reinstated in the ZAFT forces, but he has been demoted for his disobedience and no longer wears the uniform of an elite ZAFT Red. His fighting skills are as good as ever, though, and he provides invaluable support to his old partner Yzak as a member of the Joule Team.\n\n", "name": "Dearka Elsman", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/30517.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/126203.jpg?s=a624d647d267db41fbf3d13a2d06e348", "link": "/manga/593/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_SEED__Astray", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam SEED: Astray"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/19530.jpg?s=f6c356a70ff4fe3d3392c8ff02dce0af", "link": "/manga/13787/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_SEED_Destiny__The_Edge", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The Edge"}], "member-favorites": 27, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/16838.jpg?s=8463925114fc46289e748705b8d0c1c0", "link": "/anime/93/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/80485.jpg?s=75cadf39cc42e39e3cbdeca6c806df18", "link": "/anime/94/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Destiny", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/53331.jpg?s=6f5e754b18c0da85745df399eeb4ef2d", "link": "/anime/1241/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Destiny_Final_Plus__The_Chosen_Future", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny Final Plus: The Chosen Future"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/2503.jpg?s=90fd81363744ea56363148ec5b37c1db", "link": "/anime/2269/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Special_Edition", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Special Edition"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/52119.jpg?s=a8d303e7f0641ba14145b7603e9dfdac", "link": "/anime/2743/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed__Seed_Supernova_-_Tanekyara_Gekijou", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed: Seed Supernova - Tanekyara Gekijou"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30c3\u30ab\u30fb\u30a8\u30eb\u30b9\u30de\u30f3)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/49718v.jpg", "link": "/people/10/Johnny_Yong_Bosch", "name": "Bosch, Johnny Yong", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/3655v.jpg", "link": "/people/370/Brad_Swaile", "name": "Swaile, Brad", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/13023v.jpg", "link": "/people/6239/Akira_Sasanuma", "name": "Sasanuma, Akira", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/15403v.jpg", "link": "/people/14831/Jun_Seok_Song", "name": "Song, Jun Seok", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/28751v.jpg", "link": "/people/26645/Vincent_De_Bouard", "name": "De Bouard, Vincent", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/33291v.jpg", "link": "/people/32297/Ozan_\u00dcnal", "name": "\u00dcnal, Ozan", "language": "German"}]}
