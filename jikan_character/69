{"about": "Maes Hughes is a character that is hard not to love. He is often seen as the comedy relief but has his debuts as a serious and skilled fighter. He is best friends with Roy Mustang (and would do anything to help Roy achieve his goals) and a loving and devoted husband/father. Maes would do anything for his wife Gracia and always carries pictures of his daughter Elycia in his uniform and never misses a chance to show everyone how cute she is. He starts out in the anime as a Major in the Investigation Division and eventually becomes a Lieutenant Colonel.\n \n He is killed by Envy upon his discovery of Father's plans, and is posthumously promoted to Brigadier General after his death.\n\n", "name": "Maes Hughes", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/13/73469.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/27600.jpg?s=2887ac057fc76e1ccede5a4491d61c0a", "link": "/manga/25/Fullmetal_Alchemist", "name": "Fullmetal Alchemist"}], "member-favorites": 3639, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/75815.jpg?s=36a80bdbba105cd9bbf17904e4f5cfff", "link": "/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist", "name": "Fullmetal Alchemist"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/20113.jpg?s=a9d0b4a3f2cdd155d24b57d3629c4b67", "link": "/anime/430/Fullmetal_Alchemist__The_Conqueror_of_Shamballa", "name": "Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/18690.jpg?s=3cf36d8c2fcc640295e17b8db371e9a1", "link": "/anime/664/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Reflections", "name": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Reflections"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/18689.jpg?s=9b105d24bc7fef89e49b549c25261c8d", "link": "/anime/908/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Premium_Collection", "name": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Premium Collection"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/5/47421.jpg?s=30981737190576b6ce5774a80e5d590f", "link": "/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Brotherhood", "name": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/19338.jpg?s=effd8e3c2ca2a2399b9ddf769d4397a3", "link": "/anime/6421/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Brotherhood_Specials", "name": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Specials"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/3/76154.jpg?s=7ff3f7a919ad18ac68c49c50ad9d12c9", "link": "/anime/7902/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Brotherhood_-_4-Koma_Theater", "name": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - 4-Koma Theater"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30de\u30fc\u30b9\uff65\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/44665v.jpg", "link": "/people/63/Keiji_Fujiwara", "name": "Fujiwara, Keiji", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/12539v.jpg", "link": "/people/360/Sonny_Strait", "name": "Strait, Sonny", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/1236v.jpg", "link": "/people/1232/Alessandro_DErrico", "name": "D'Errico, Alessandro", "language": "Italian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/2762v.jpg", "link": "/people/6126/Simon_T_Roden", "name": "Roden, Simon T.", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/5117v.jpg", "link": "/people/7855/P\u00e1l_Oberfrank", "name": "Oberfrank, P\u00e1l", "language": "Hungarian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/9884/Cyrille_Monge", "name": "Monge, Cyrille", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/15757v.jpg", "link": "/people/14829/Il_Kim", "name": "Kim, Il", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/42494v.jpg", "link": "/people/28299/Luiz_Laffey", "name": "Laffey, Luiz", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/49422v.jpg", "link": "/people/45919/Miguel_\u00c1ngel_Montero", "name": "Montero, Miguel \u00c1ngel", "language": "Spanish"}]}
