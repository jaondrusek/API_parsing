{"about": "Tsutsui is the nerdy and kind hearted Haze junior high school Go club president who uses a play book while playing in tournaments. While he is not a strong Go player and doesn't play too well, he loves the game and plays with a positive attitude. Hikaru first meets Tsutsui in a \"Terakoya\" fair (it's Japanese food; octopus dumplings) where he would give out prizes to individuals who solved Go puzzles in Kouyo Tonya's book. At that time, Tsutusi was the only member of the Go club and was trying to recruit other members so his Go club can compete in tournaments with other junior high schools.\n \n (Source: unrivaled.info)\n\n", "name": "Kimihiro Tsutsui", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/75251.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/170574.jpg?s=9219e2b389c68380032347d44c6cec1d", "link": "/manga/20/Hikaru_no_Go", "name": "Hikaru no Go"}], "member-favorites": 1, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/12/78317.jpg?s=1535e87674c529f600323303ed4a1f0e", "link": "/anime/135/Hikaru_no_Go", "name": "Hikaru no Go"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/11/60751.jpg?s=da9700bb7e53465e66025b1420c29551", "link": "/anime/2336/Hikaru_no_Go__New_Year_Special", "name": "Hikaru no Go: New Year Special"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/29669.jpg?s=7175a35226f4241912933bb709cab9bc", "link": "/anime/10765/Hikaru_no_Go_Special", "name": "Hikaru no Go Special"}], "name-japanese": "(\u7b52\u4e95 \u516c\u5b8f)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/31619v.jpg", "link": "/people/648/Makoto_Tsumura", "name": "Tsumura, Makoto", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/23223v.jpg", "link": "/people/11847/Keith_Miller", "name": "Miller, Keith", "language": "English"}]}
