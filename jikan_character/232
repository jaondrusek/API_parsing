{"about": "Kojima is known as \"Dragonfly\" on online BBS boards, and like Minoru, is also a custom Persocom builder. His obsessions with Persocoms are shown when he kidnaps Chii in order to find out more about her origins after hearing about her on the BBS board where Minoru posted. He later makes amends for his actions by helping Hideki and Minoru find out more about Chii's origins and the Chobits.\n\n", "name": "Yoshiyuki Kojima", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/103262.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/164969.jpg?s=b39419fa5fc6444e3558dc8309fc32ec", "link": "/manga/107/Chobits", "name": "Chobits"}], "member-favorites": 1, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/24648.jpg?s=5b6343af2882765f8ae9d92247c619af", "link": "/anime/59/Chobits", "name": "Chobits"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/22857.jpg?s=26d23d100fdcc0e8c94f536835c614e4", "link": "/anime/1311/Chobits_Recap", "name": "Chobits Recap"}], "name-japanese": "(\u5c0f\u5cf6 \u826f\u7531\u8d77)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/44598v.jpg", "link": "/people/95/Junichi_Suwabe", "name": "Suwabe, Junichi", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/16179v.jpg", "link": "/people/321/Terrence_Stone", "name": "Stone, Terrence", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/11679v.jpg", "link": "/people/12219/Marco_Steeger", "name": "Steeger, Marco", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/15675v.jpg", "link": "/people/14931/Yeong_Jae_Pyo", "name": "Pyo, Yeong Jae", "language": "Korean"}]}
