{"about": "Age: 21 \n Sex: Male \n Birthday: 12th August \n Height: 182 cm \n Weight: 72 kg \n Bloodtype: A \n \n First introduced as the Beastmaster, he has the ability to control animals, although perhaps it should be better stated that he asks them for favors as he views animals as his friends. Once Volts disbanded, Shido left the Infinity Fortress to make a living outside, like Ginji. After reconciling with Ginji (whom he felt had betrayed Volts by leaving the Infinity Fortress), Shido took a cue from the Get Backers and started his own retrieval service - occasionally aided by Emishi. He is very independent and cold to others. Even though his powers allow him to control animals, he considers them friends, and tries to protect them as they do him. He eventually ends up living with Otowa Madoka, and he has an ongoing rivalry with Ban; he calls Ban \"snake bastard\" (\"Snake-for-Brains\" in the anime) while Ban&#039;s retort is often \"saru-mashi\" (monkey boy) or, due to to his stay with Madoka, \"pimp\".\n \n In Volts, Shido is paired with Kurusu Masaki to protect the East Gates of the Infinity Fortress. Due to this, he knows a lot about Masaki and his followers, although it is doubted he knows about Masaki&#039;s true identity as a vassal for the Voodoo King. He remarks that Masaki has changed a lot from what he used to be , &#039;a man who will protect the weak.&#039;\n\n", "name": "Shido Fuyuki", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/2/30668.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/169369.jpg?s=000159ab8b976453e411f286a9fd2123", "link": "/manga/19/GetBackers", "name": "GetBackers"}], "member-favorites": 27, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/7547.jpg?s=1d609b0d24353fd55a3572dd135404cc", "link": "/anime/132/GetBackers", "name": "GetBackers"}], "name-japanese": "(\u51ac\u6728 \u58eb\u5ea6)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/16605v.jpg", "link": "/people/1052/Takanori_Hoshino", "name": "Hoshino, Takanori", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/38431v.jpg", "link": "/people/9896/\u00c1ngel_Balam", "name": "Balam, \u00c1ngel", "language": "Spanish"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/14941v.jpg", "link": "/people/14489/Dado_Monteiro", "name": "Monteiro, Dado", "language": "Brazilian"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/16483v.jpg", "link": "/people/15299/Min_Seok_Kim", "name": "Kim, Min Seok", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/27159v.jpg", "link": "/people/24513/Omar_Gallaga", "name": "Gallaga, Omar", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/46032/Jordi_Nogueras", "name": "Nogueras, Jordi", "language": "Spanish"}]}
