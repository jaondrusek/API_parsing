{"about": "Hiroyasu Ueda  is the owner of Chiroru, a local bakery which Yumi once worked in and which Chi ends up working at. He is 38 years old, although he looks as though he is only in his mid-20's, at one point noting jokingly that he has a \"baby face\". He, too, has suffered a trauma involving persocoms. \n \n When he first opened his bakery, he bought a persocom to help with math and accounting, which he admits he is terrible at. He eventually fell in love with this persocom and then married her, but she developed a hard disk fault which resulted in the gradual degradation of her memory, until she remembered almost nothing at all.\n \n Rarely, she would suddenly recall small fragments of memories from her life with Hiroyasu. He could not bring himself to have her repaired because her memories might be lost completely in the process of transferring them to a new hard drive, and he felt she would not be the same person if this happened. Soon, her memory degraded to the point that she could not remember anything for more than a few seconds at a time, and Hiroyasu had keep a constant watch on her to prevent her from wandering away. One night while walking with his persocom, Hiroyasu, lost in thought, walked into the middle of the street, unaware of an oncoming car. In one final moment of clarity, his persocom pushed him out of the way, and was herself run over. Her last words to Hiroyasu were, \"Konnichiwa.\"\n \n Hiroyasu and Yumi Omura were in love in the past, but broke up when Yumi quit her job at the bakery when she discovered that the persocom he married was named \"Yumi\" and feared she would never live up to the other Yumi. Through the help of Chi and Hideki, he and Yumi resume their relationship.\n \n (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n", "name": "Hiroyasu Ueda", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/139271.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/164969.jpg?s=b39419fa5fc6444e3558dc8309fc32ec", "link": "/manga/107/Chobits", "name": "Chobits"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/2/154345.jpg?s=3f9cf088fd8824cca66c04dd3462e66e", "link": "/manga/118/Kobato", "name": "Kobato."}], "member-favorites": 7, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/24648.jpg?s=5b6343af2882765f8ae9d92247c619af", "link": "/anime/59/Chobits", "name": "Chobits"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/22857.jpg?s=26d23d100fdcc0e8c94f536835c614e4", "link": "/anime/1311/Chobits_Recap", "name": "Chobits Recap"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/79838.jpg?s=c68b4e3d1fb4cfa39f2fceca6f599eab", "link": "/anime/5678/Kobato", "name": "Kobato."}], "name-japanese": "(\u690d\u7530 \u5f18\u5eb7)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/45741v.jpg", "link": "/people/12/Steven_Blum", "name": "Blum, Steven", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/10153v.jpg", "link": "/people/58/Yuji_Ueda", "name": "Ueda, Yuji", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/21881v.jpg", "link": "/people/11858/Tomoyuki_Higuchi", "name": "Higuchi, Tomoyuki", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/15675v.jpg", "link": "/people/14931/Yeong_Jae_Pyo", "name": "Pyo, Yeong Jae", "language": "Korean"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/50179v.jpg", "link": "/people/46537/Claudi_Domingo", "name": "Domingo, Claudi", "language": "Spanish"}]}
