{"about": "Age: 30(GS), 32(GSD)\n Birthday: July 20\t\n Blood type: B\t\n Genetic type: Coordinator\t\n Height: 181 cm\t\n Alias: Desert Tiger\t\n Mobile suit: TMF/A-802 BuCUE, TMF/A-803 LaGOWE, MVF-M11C Murasame Waltfeld Custom, ZGMF-X88S Gaia Waltfeld Custom\n \n Gundam SEED\n The commander of a ZAFT  force based in the occupied city of Banadiya  in northern Africa. Renowned as the \"Desert Tiger\" for his exploits on the African front, Waltfeld proves a formidable opponent for the Archangel crew and the Desert Dawn  resistance fighters, and he often leaves the bridge of his land battleship Lesseps and enters the battlefield to observe his enemies up close. Even in the heat of combat, Waltfeld retains his relaxed and casual attitude, and only a few things seem to excite his emotions - sampling exotic coffees, debating the pros and cons of kebab sauces, and matching wits with the pilot of the Strike Gundam.\n \n Gundam SEED Destiny\n Like Murrue Ramius, ZAFT&#039;s famous Desert Tiger relocated to Orb after the previous war. Even while living in relative seclusion, Waltfeld has maintained his own intelligence network to monitor the deteriorating world situation, and he remains a capable soldier despite the injuries he has suffered in his past battles.\n\n", "name": "Andrew Waltfeld", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/7/30427.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/5/184670.jpg?s=5d07378e882b95783ca1734a0c480507", "link": "/manga/345/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_SEED__X_Astray", "name": "Kidou Senshi Gundam SEED: X Astray"}], "member-favorites": 41, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/16838.jpg?s=8463925114fc46289e748705b8d0c1c0", "link": "/anime/93/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/4/80485.jpg?s=75cadf39cc42e39e3cbdeca6c806df18", "link": "/anime/94/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Destiny", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/9/53331.jpg?s=6f5e754b18c0da85745df399eeb4ef2d", "link": "/anime/1241/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Destiny_Final_Plus__The_Chosen_Future", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny Final Plus: The Chosen Future"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/1/2503.jpg?s=90fd81363744ea56363148ec5b37c1db", "link": "/anime/2269/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Special_Edition", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Special Edition"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/2/18686.jpg?s=8daafaf00bb0a4c566a9faf53d3d0548", "link": "/anime/2294/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_Seed_Destiny_Special_Edition", "name": "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny Special Edition"}], "name-japanese": "(\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30eb\u30c8\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30c9)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/10519v.jpg", "link": "/people/177/Ryotaro_Okiayu", "name": "Okiayu, Ryotaro", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/39588v.jpg", "link": "/people/515/Brian_Drummond", "name": "Drummond, Brian", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/3/2747v.jpg", "link": "/people/6110/Matthias_Hinze", "name": "Hinze, Matthias", "language": "German"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/questionmark_23.gif", "link": "/people/6796/Jerome_Keen", "name": "Keen, Jerome", "language": "French"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/15349v.jpg", "link": "/people/14775/Seok_jeong_Yang", "name": "Yang, Seok jeong", "language": "Korean"}]}
