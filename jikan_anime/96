Dominance over the colonies is decided once every four years by a large tournament in which each nation sends a single representative to fight the others with a giant robot called a Gundam. Domon Kashuu is selected to represent Neo-Japan in one of these tournaments, but he fights less to ensure his nation&#039;s victory than to find his brother, who has been blamed for the deaths of Domon&#039;s parents and the disappearance of a very dangerous weapon, the Dark Gundam or Devil Gundam.
