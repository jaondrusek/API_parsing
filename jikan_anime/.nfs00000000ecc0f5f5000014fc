This was due to anime censorship having increased following the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively.Cowboy Bebop&#039;s biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show&#039;s heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a &quot;gateway drug&quot; to anime aimed at adult audiences.", "broadcast": "Saturdays at 01:00 (JST)", "ranked": 24, "studio": ["14/Sunrise", "Sunrise"], "members": 586030, "genre": [["1/Action", "Action"], ["2/Adventure", "Adventure"], ["4/Comedy", "Comedy"], ["8/Drama", "Drama"], ["24/Sci-Fi", "Sci-Fi"], ["29/Space", "Space"]], "popularity": 33, "premiered": "Spring 1998", "synopsis": "In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind.
