Budgetary problems and parental complaints about content led to the original ending being scrapped and replaced with an extremely limited-animation ending breaking from the main plot. A movie, End of Evangelion, was later made based in part on the original planned ending and in part on Anno&#039;s increasing frustration with the otaku fanbase. The series&#039; mix of psychoanalysis, religious symbolism, and genre deconstruction proved extremely influential on mature anime in the late &#039;90s onward. The Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006 ranked it as the most popular anime of all time.
