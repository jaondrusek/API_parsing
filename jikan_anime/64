So when a note appears on his desk, asking whether or not he would wind something, he assumes it was something he ordered and carelessly circles &quot;yes,&quot; changing his life forever. A box arrives with a wind up doll inside, but this is no ordinary toy: after Jun winds her up, she begins walking and talking as if a normal person. With a haughty attitude, she introduces herself as Shinku, the fifth doll in the Rozen Maiden collection, a group of special dolls made by the legendary dollmaker Rozen. These sisters must battle each other in a competition called the Alice Game with the help of a human to ensure victory. The winner becomes Alice, a real girl who is worthy of meeting their creator. As more sentient dolls end up taking residence in Jun&#039;s house, and a foe from Shinku&#039;s past makes her appearance, Jun&#039;s life becomes far more complicated than he ever thought possible.
