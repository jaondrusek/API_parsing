Day in and day out, putting his life on the line just to make enough to get by, he moves from one bloodshed to the next. After a run-in with the Band of the Hawk, a formidable troop of mercenaries, Guts is recruited by their charismatic leader Griffith, nicknamed the &quot;White Hawk.&quot; As he quickly climbed the ranks in order to become the head of the offensive faction, Guts proves to be a mighty addition to Griffith&#039;s force, taking Midland by storm. However, while the band&#039;s quest for recognition continues, Guts slowly realizes that the world is not as black-and-white as he once assumed. Set in the medieval era, Kenpuu Denki Berserk is a dark, gritty tale that follows one man&#039;s struggle to find his own path, while supporting another&#039;s lust for power, and the unimaginable tragedy that begins to turn the wheels of fate.
