Which may be part of why new transfer student Agate Fluorite doesn&#039;t quite seem to fit in. It&#039;s not just that Agate&#039;s enthusiastic attitude stands out among the somber, brooding balance of the student body. There&#039;s something about him that demands notice, even from jaded honors students like Beryl Jasper, and from the moment of arrival he&#039;s been at the center of a series of mysteries that not even Agate understands. Because Agate&#039;s not just another student, he&#039;s part of a something so momentous, and dangerous, that the world that built Cluster Edge may not survive its passing.
