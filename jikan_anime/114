But would your average high school student really enroll himself at the infamous Cromartie High School, known as a breeding ground for the toughest delinquents out there? Apparently so, as that is exactly what Takashi does, though for reasons he&#039;d rather leave unmentioned. However, one thing is for sure: the &quot;hard-boiled rabbit in a den full of hungry lions&quot; is never going to have another dull day. And how could he, now that he&#039;s surrounded by mohawked punks, obnoxious robots, and... gorillas? And was that Freddie Mercury riding a horse down the corridor? Follow Takashi as he earnestly dedicates his new high school life to better his school&#039;s reputation while his classmates are hellbent on wreaking havoc.
