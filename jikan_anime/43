It heavily condenses the original storyline, reducing the original material&#039;s comic relief and sexual content in favor of a more serious tone and changing the setting from Japan to a city modelled after Hong Kong. The artwork within the animated film was produced using an innovative mix of cel animation and digital effects. Ghost in the Shell is one of the world&#039;s most famous Japanese animated films, being the first to reach #1 on Billboard magazine&#039;s video best-seller list, and also served as a major inspiration for the Wachowskis in their creation of the Matrix movies. A special edition titled Ghost in the Shell: 2.0 was released in 2008, which features scenes reanimated with additional CGI to match the style of the 2004&#039;s sequel, Ghost in the Shell: Innocence.", "ranked": 193, "studio": ["10/Production_IG", "Production I.G"], "members": 278682, "genre": [["1/Action", "Action"], ["24/Sci-Fi", "Sci-Fi"], ["39/Police", "Police"], ["40/Psychological", "Psychological"], ["18/Mecha", "Mecha"], ["42/Seinen", "Seinen"]], "popularity": 166, "episodes": 1, "synopsis": "In the year 2029, advances in Cybernetics allow people to replace nearly all of their body parts and organs with robotics.

Major Motoko Kusanagi has full-body prosthetics, owing to a childhood accident. She, her second in command Batou and information specialist Ishikawa have been assigned an important task: to investigate a hacker known only as &quot;The Puppetmaster.&quot; But as Motoko and her team discover, things are never so simple.
